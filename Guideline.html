                    <h4 style="color: brown;"> Publishing Guidelines</h4>

We publish unique and high-quality articles that focus on topics of creativity, writing, editing, and publishing. We are always in search of original content that helps writers improve their skills. All contributors are required to submit researched and unique materials, providing a creative perspective that our readers can apply to enhance their own abilities.

We adhere to an editorial policy that requires each author to take full responsibility for ensuring that their articles meet the highest quality standards and comply with all journal requirements. Only papers demonstrating a high level of objectivity and structural quality will be considered after the approval stage. The editorial board consists of at least specialized reviewers, and articles are reviewed post-approval. Upon submission, copyright transfer of articles is granted to the journal, including reproduction, distribution, translation, images, electronic formats, or any other similar nature.

Authors must ensure that their contributions are original and do not violate any copyright or other ownership rights. We encourage innovation and pioneering ideas, aiming to provide a vibrant environment for the dissemination of original research. We also seek to enhance academic interaction, encouraging the exchange of ideas and innovations across different cultures and specialties.

<h4 style="color: brown;">Journal Copyright Terms</h4> 

<br>
The copyright in our journal includes exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the contribution, including copies, translations, photographic images, thumbnails, electronic formats, or any other similar nature. Authors are not allowed to publish their contribution elsewhere without prior written permission from the publisher unless it has been substantially changed. Authors guarantee that their contributions are original, excluding excerpts from copyrighted works included with permission from the copyright owner. Authors are encouraged to disclose any financial or personal relationships that could be perceived as bias in their work.

In return for these rights, each author is responsible for ensuring the writing of the submitted manuscripts related to literary theft while adhering to ethical standards. All submissions are carefully examined for plagiarism, and if an attempt at literary theft is found in a published article, authors will be asked to issue a written apology to the original authors. Any article showing clear signs of plagiarism will be automatically rejected, and its authors may be banned for two years from publishing in the journal.

Authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with individuals or organizations that could potentially affect their work. This includes examples of potential conflicts of interest such as employment, consultancy, stock ownership, fees, paid expert testimony, patent applications, and grants or other forms of funding.

Submitting an article implies that the work described has not been published previously, is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, and that its publication has been approved by all authors. If accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, electronically or in any other language, without written consent from the copyright owner. To verify authenticity, authors will have an opportunity to make corrections in the final manuscript before article publication.
